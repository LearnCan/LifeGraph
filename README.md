# Life Graph

## Introduction

To maximize the potential of every human being, we can now leverage AI to interpret the entirety of a person and adapt to an individual's life experiences, skills, education, and learning modalities. To achieve this, a single, secure, logical entity capturing all kinds of learning, skills, and experiences from year to year, from early education onwards, including non-traditional experiences is required. 

For example: When a child goes from first grade to second grade, any AI learning platform will need a comprehensive understanding of discrete areas where a student needs challenging or where the child needs support. Similarly, an adult who was raised on a dairy farm may have untapped potential in a lab environment having a basic understanding of sterilization. A Lifegraph helps surface connections in a person's life to provide them with personalized, adaptive learning paths, opportunities, and more chances of success. 

The Life Graph is a protocol, covering the data schema and secure access conceptualized to be owned by the individual, engineered with a focus on security and privacy, ensuring levels of access are granted solely by and from the individual owner. 

## Project Vision

The Life Graph project seeks to establish a set of open-source standards for a comprehensive learning and experience schema. This initiative aims to document and recognize the full spectrum of an individual's learning journey, facilitating lifelong education, career progression, and personal development. We are at the very beginning of this journey and invite collaboration and contributions to shape these standards.

## Call for Contribution

The Life Graph is in its nascent stage, requiring contributions from individuals and organizations across various disciplines. We are looking to collaborate on:

- **Privacy:** Developing robust privacy controls and data protection measures to safeguard personal information.
- **Security:** Establishing secure protocols to ensure data integrity and safe access.
- **Schema Structure:** Designing a flexible yet comprehensive schema that can capture a wide range of learning experiences and skills.
- **Integration Standards:** Creating guidelines for integrating the Life Graph with educational platforms, career services, and AI systems.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in the form of ideas, standards proposals, technical expertise, and community engagement strategies. To contribute:

1. **Join the Discussion:** Participate in our forums or on our collaboration platforms to discuss ideas and proposals.
2. **Submit Proposals:** We encourage the submission of detailed proposals for any of the key areas mentioned above.
3. **Provide Feedback:** Feedback on existing proposals and standards is invaluable and helps refine the direction of the project.

## Roadmap

1. **Establish Core Working Groups:** For privacy, security, schema structure, and integration standards.
2. **Develop Initial Drafts:** Of the Life Graph standards in each key area.
3. **Public Review and Feedback:** Engage the broader community for feedback and revisions.
4. **Finalize Standards:** Consolidate feedback and finalize the initial set of standards for the Life Graph.

## Getting Involved

Your expertise and input can help shape the future of learning and personal development. To get involved:

- **Review existing discussions and documents:** Familiarize yourself with the work already underway.
- **Share your expertise:** Whether you're a privacy advocate, security expert, educational professional, or passionate about lifelong learning, your knowledge is valuable.
